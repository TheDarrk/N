soo what things we are currently need to do better is
1st for now comment out text to speech we dont need that for now will look into it later
2nd  things are working smooth but for some pairs it doesnt provide quote while on other near intents swaps it fettches quotes...so i think sometime it doesnt fetch quote for a single api hit so we need 5-8 hits limit till we get a quote and if not will return cant fetch quote
and for now its not looking like a ai agent is it looks like a pre text bot because when i ask anything more about it it just say i am for swap only because it does intent detection yes i told you to do but not that way....user can talk to ai agent also it also provides the answer or information but afcourse near and swap related like if a ask him what you do or can you swap things what coins are available it should respond to these text not like just plain answer....prepare a langchain for that and a master prompt so when ai agent knows user want to swap things it call the tools and all it should look like an ai agent who is working for you.....
and also user can mis spell that words of coin and all for that what i am thinking is you should call near intent api and get the available coins list and made a dict and check if user miss spell the agent should confirm with the correct name....
and also near intent can work with cross chain swap also in same chain swap the recever and sender wallet address are same but for cross chain swap ai agent should ask for address if not provide and also validate it if its legit or not..(for rg if user enter near adrress 123.ner its wrong and ai agent perform the trnx result in fund lost where if agent check is the vcalid adress that can be done as many wallet provider doing it before you sign trnx)
and our agent should not answer anything out of context rellated to swaps and near for that we have 2 layers i think also 1st will decide if user want to swap or just need some info regarding swap like what is the rate and what are the available coins if user want to swap then it should call the tools and all and 2nd layer will excute the trnx....
